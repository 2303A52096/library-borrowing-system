# Library Borrowing System (Frontend-only)

Two versions:
- `monolithic-version/` — single-file HTML prototype
- `mvc-version/` — MVC separation (model.js, view.js, controller.js)

## Features
- Student: view available books, borrow a book (no login)
- Admin: login (admin/admin), add books, view & mark returned
- Data stored in browser localStorage — no backend required

## How to run
1. Open `monolithic-version/index.html` or `mvc-version/index.html` in your browser.
2. Use admin credentials: `admin` / `admin`.
3. Take screenshots: student view, borrow, admin panel, add book, borrowed list.

## Files included
- HTML/CSS/JS files for both versions
- PlantUML text for UML diagrams (Use Case, Class, Component)
- Short report text in `report.md` (optional)

## Notes for graders
This is a frontend-only demo to illustrate architecture differences (Monolith vs MVC) — suitable for assignment demonstration and documentation.
